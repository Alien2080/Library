# Library App
Work in Progress. 
Simple app made with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.   
Saves library to ~~[Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)~~ Firebase with no authentication (for now). Meaning everyone gets access to the same data.   

## Description
A List of books. Books can be removed and added.  

## Planned features
- ~~add books~~
- set is read on books  
- styling  
- ~~persistant storage using [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart)~~
- authentication for Firebase
- rules setup in Firebase

## How To Use
As it only uses ~~Local Storage~~ Firebase without authentication (for now) just use the [Live Demo](https://alien2080.github.io/Library/).
