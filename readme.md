# Library App
Work in Progress. 
Simple app made with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.   
Saves library to [Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)   

## Description
A List of books. Values are hard coded for testing for now. Books can be removed.  

## Planned features
- add books  
- set is read on books  
- styling  
- persistant storage using [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart)  

## How To Use
As it only uses Local Storage (for now) just use the [Live Demo](https://alien2080.github.io/Library/).
