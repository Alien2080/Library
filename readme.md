# Library App
Work in Progress. 
Simple app made with vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Firebase.   
Inspired from a project in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library)     

## Description
A collection of books. Books can be removed, added and marked as Read.    

## Authentication
If user authenticates (with Google_ then library data is saved to [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart).  
Without authentication the library data is saved to [Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
